## Not your crazy uncle's mushrooms
Random daily writing

A young couple here in Germany is harvesting 150kg of fresh mushrooms every week from 100m2 "fields" in a basement. This is the sole and sufficient income for the two of them. Mushrooms have an average harvest lifecycle of four weeks, and as a fungus, do not require sunlight.

Interestingly, the shells of soy beans are considered the premium substrate for mushroom growers and for reasons outside the scope of this post, I have access to a LOT of soy.

In response, my farming brother-in-law and I each ordered a few test bags of mushrooms to grow at home to explore the market. Whether this is a good idea or  a bad one, time will tell.
