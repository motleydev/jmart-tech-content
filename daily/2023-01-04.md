## Better to be around sick people
Random daily writing

An immune system that is frequently engaged in fighting sickness is generally stronger than one that doesn't have to fight with viruses. This has been the largest contributing factor to the increase in sickness this year as we met a perfect storm of isolating everyone's immune system, then throwing them back into an open pot of sickness with zero phase-in.

I hold that masking up was wrong for the majority along with social distancing, but to have the one without a phased in "return to normal" was probably more of a double foot-gun than we ever intended.
