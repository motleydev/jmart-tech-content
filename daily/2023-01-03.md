## You get to use your feet
Random daily writing

Today was a birthday and we took the kids to the climbing hall. The strata of bravery tends to ebb wildly depending on the child, and where one is convinced that the last stone of the boulder wall is merely a foothold to summit the entire scaffold, the other hangs timidly onto any color stone that seems most secure.

The timid child, fell to the same unfortunate circumstance over-and-over. They'd get half way up the wall, and really only needed to stand up and they'd have reached the top stones on many routes, but unable to separate the distance off the ground with the solid footing, ended in a compression the higher up the wall they want, where, if they'd only used their feet and legs, they'd have finished double as many of routes.
