## It's dangerous to go alone
Random daily writing

My kids (7 and 9) had a proper adventure this evening. Of course, that sits on a scale of what the average western child in a rural farming town experiences at that age, but, for their growing scale, new boundaries were set. Through a series of miscommunications, they found themselves biking through a cold, foggy, patchwork array of farm fields, feeling entirely lost.

We'd arranged for them to make loop a known circuit as we walked the same, and they would rejoin us. Through the wire-crossing, they'd taken a different turn, and though we were able to see them the entire time, they, did not know it.

It was fun to see the the many times we'd talked through these types of scenarios, the outplaying of stone-written laws of the hierarchy of sibling pecking-order and a descent dose of common sense come together.

Though my kids were shook by it, they passed this unplanned test with flying colors, but also confirmed the importance of the "what-if" game. Giving the kids even the smallest handful of options to play in unplanned eventuality is as critical for first-graders as it is for first-time founders, or anyone else experiencing firsts.
